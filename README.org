#+Title: Scraping real time data using ipython 

Ipython - realtime data
watching the number of flights on your emacs:

This experiment tested on python 2.7 and emacs - ipython notebook (ein).

For ipython notebook installation see this webpage ipython.

To run this example you need to install some external modes

requests and BeautifulSoup

If you use pip (recommended) open the terminal and type

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
pip install requests
pip install beautifulsoup4
#+END_EXAMPLE

Go to the web page to scrape the number of flights

https://www.flightradar24.com/56.16,-49.51/7

The number is updated every 8 seconds.

To be able to collect the number of flights in real time, go and find the .js file in the webpage. To find the js file go to: Chrome - more tools- developer tools - network - there you'll find the requests under the name =feed.js=.

Now, run the below code in you ipython notebook.
#+BEGIN_SRC python
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import time

def get_count():
    url = "https://data-live.flightradar24.com/zones/fcgi/feed.js?bounds=59.09,
52.64,-58.77,-47.71&faa=1&mlat=1&flarm=1&adsb=1&gnd=1&air=1&vehicles=1&estimated
=1&maxage=7200&gliders=1&stats=1"

    # Request with fake header, otherwise you will get an 403 HTTP error
    r = requests.get(url, headers={'User-Agent': 'Mozilla/5.0'})

    # Parse the JSON
    data = r.json()
    counter = 0

    # Iterate over the elements to get the number of total flights
    for element in data["stats"]["total"]:
        counter += data["stats"]["total"][element]

    return counter

while True:
    print(get_count())
    time.sleep(8)

#+END_SRC
